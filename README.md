PART I: Diploid Cellular Automata

1.1 Framework and definition of diploid CA

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
In elementary cellular automata (ECA) all cells are updated synchronously so that the state of each cell is updated according to the state of the cell itself and to that of the two neighboring cells. The set of these three cells will be called neighborhood of a given cell. More precisely, given a local rule f, we denote by F : Xn ‚Üí Xn the map defined by letting

(F(x))i = f(xi‚àí1,xi,xi+1)

for any cell i. The Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) associated with the local rule f is the collection of all the sequences of configurations (xt)t‚ààN obtained by applying the map F iteratively, namely, such that xt = F(xt‚àí1). The particular sequence (xt)t‚ààN such that x0 = x ‚àà Xn is called trajectory of the cellular automaton associated with the initial condition x.

Each of the possible 256 local rules f is identified by the integer number W ‚àà {0,‚Ä¶,255} such that

W =f(0,0,0)¬∑20 +f(0,0,1)¬∑21 +f(0,1,0)¬∑22 +f(0,1,1)¬∑23 +¬∑¬∑¬∑+f(1,1,1)¬∑27 that is to say the collection of the digits

f(1, 1, 1)f(1, 1, 0)f(1, 0, 1)f(1, 0, 0)f(0, 1, 1)f(0, 1, 0)f(0, 0, 1)f(0, 0, 0)

is the binary representation of the number W.

Some examples. The rule 0 is called the null rule and associates the state 0 to any

configuration in the neighborhood. The rule 22 associates the state 0 to any configuration in the neighborhood but for the three local configurations in which one single 1 is present in the neighborhood (001, 010, and 100) to which it associates 1. The rule 150 associates the state 0 to any configuration in the neighborhood but for the four local configurations in which an odd number of 1‚Äôs is present in the neighborhood (001, 010, 100, and 111) to which it associates 1. The rule 204 is called the identity and associates to any configuration in the neighborhood the state of the cell at the center (namely, the cell that one is going to update). The rule 224 associates the state 1 to any configuration in

the neighborhood but for the local configuration 000 to which it associates 0. The rule 232 is called the majority rule and associates to any configuration in the neighborhood the majority state, namely 0 to 000, 001, 010, and 100 and 1 to the others. The rule 255 associates the state 1 to any configuration in the neighborhood. Finally, note that all the rules represented by an even number associated to the local configuration 000 the states 0.

In this context a Probabilistic Cellular Automata, called probabilistic or stochastic ECA, is a Markov chain (Œæt)t‚ààN on the configuration space Xn with transition matrix

p(x, y) = Ùè∞á pi(yi|x) with pi(yi|x) = yiœÜ(xi‚àí1, xi, xi+1) + (1 ‚àí yi)[1 ‚àí œÜ(xi‚àí1, xi, xi+1)] i‚ààLn

(1) where œÜ has to be interpreted as the probability to set the cell to 1 given the neighborhood xi‚àí1xixi+1 and, similarly, 1‚àíœÜ the probability select 0. We denote by Px the probability associated with the process started at x ‚àà Xn. We shall denote by Œºxt (y) = Px(Œæt = y) the probability that the chain started at x will be in the configuration y at time t. Abusing the notation, Œºxt (Y ) = Px(Œæt ‚àà Y ) will denote the probability that the chain

started at x will be in the set of configurations Y ‚äÇ Xn at time t.

An important class of stochastic ECA is made of those models obtained by randomly

mixing two of the 256 elementary cellular automata. More precisely, given Œª ‚àà (0, 1) and picked two local rules f1 Ã∏= f2, the stochastic ECA defined by

œÜ = (1‚àíŒª)f1 +Œªf2 (2)

is called a diploid ECA. Note that in the limiting cases Œª = 0, 1 or f1 = f2 a (determin- istic) ECA is recovered.

It is important to note that the time evolution of the diploid ECA can be described as follows: at time t for each cell i one chooses either the rule f1 with probability 1 ‚àí Œª or the rule f2 with probability Œª and performs the updating based on the neighborhood configuration at time t ‚àí 1. Indeed, with this algorithm the probability to set the cell to1atimetis0iff1 =0andf2 =0(wherethelocalrulesarecomputedinthe neighborhood configuration at time t‚àí1), 1‚àíŒª if f1 = 1 and f2 = 0, Œª if f1 = 0 and f2 = 1, 1 if f1 = 1 and f2 = 1, which is coherent with the definition (2).

1.2 The project

We start trying to simulate diploid ECA of the type:

œÜ = (1‚àíŒª)f1 +Œªf2

Here, we focus on models in which f1 is the null rule (i.e. rule 0) and f2 is any other

rule in the following list:

F2 := { 18,22,26,28,30,50,54,58,60,62,78,90,94,110, 122, 126, 146, 150, 154, 156, 158, 178, 182, 186, 188, 190, 202, 206, 218, 234, 238, 250, 254}

<li>Try to estimate the curve of the density in function of the parameter Œª, trying to be more accurate around the points where you notice a change of behavior. For instance increase Œª by step of 0.05 and then by steps of 0.01 near the sudden change of density.</li>
<li>QUESTION: critically study the behaviour of the density.</li>
<li>QUESTION: is there any abrupt change of behavior?</li>
<li>QUESTION: do you think, from the indication of your plot that the system has a phase transition in Œª (e.g. first or second order)?</li>
<li>QUESTION: if yes, is there any indication of the presence of any critical Œª?</li>
<li>QUESTION: if you look carefully at the list F, you might notice that it contains only even rules. What do you think would happen heuristically in case of an odd f2 rule?</li>
</ul>
1.4 Theoretical study (f2 is rule 204)

Consider the diploid with f2 being the rule 255. Each cell is updated independently on the others and also on the past. Hence, the evolution of a cell amounts to be a sequence of Bernoulli variables with parameter Œª. Thus, the invariant measure of the chain is product and for each cell it is equal to œÄi(0) = 1 ‚àí Œª and œÄi(1) = Œª.

Consider now the diploid with f2 being the identity (rule 204). For this model the configuration 0 is a fixed point (also called stationary state ), in the sense that p(0, x) = 0 for any x ‚àà Xn. The cells are updated independently one from each other but not on the past. The chain can be described as a collection of n single cell Markov chains evolving with the following transition matrix

pi(0,0)=1, pi(0,1)=0, pi(1,0)=1‚àíŒª, pi(1,1)=Œª.

for any cell i. The stationary measure is product and the single cell stationary measure

is concentrated on 0, namely, œÄi(0) = 1 and œÄi(1) = 0. 3

<li>QUESTION: For a single cell started at 1, calculate the probability that its state is0attimet. FortheallchainshowthatŒº1t(0)=(1‚àíŒªt)n.</li>
<li>QUESTION: Try to obtain the probability of reaching at time t the configuration with all zeros if started in the configuration with all ones (Œº1t (0)) of the previous point by using the multinomial theorem. In fact, one can rewrite the probability as sum over all the ways in which 1‚Äôs are removed once we know that Ùè∞Ütk=1 sk = n, where sk is the number of ones removed at time k.</li>
<li>QUESTION: Now, suppose to compute this probability on a time scale diverging logarithmically with n, namely, take t = Œ±logn, for some Œ± &gt; 0. Show that, for any Œª ‚àà (0,1), if Œ± &lt; ‚àí1/logŒª then Œº1t(0) tends to 0 in the infinite volume limit, whereas it tends to 1 if Œ± &gt; ‚àí1/logŒª.</li>
<li>For this simple model you have showed that: fixed Œª on a time scale smaller than (‚àí1/ log Œª) log n the chain started at 1 stays in 1. On a time scale larger than (‚àí1/ log Œª) log n it converges to the configuration 0. Note that in this model this happens for any value of Œª. This suggests that in the other models, something similar is observed but only for Œª small enough.</li>
<li>QUESTION: Despite rule 204 is not in the list F2, does this heuristics shed some light on what it is going on? Come back to the simulation studies you have performed. The previous observation is consistent with what you have observed?</li>

PART II

You have to choose and solve only one of the following two projects: Asynchronous CA or Explicit solution of a CA described in the following sections.

2.1 Asynchronous CA

This part of the project would like to investigate the robustness of CA to asynchronous updating via the so called Œ± ‚àí asynchronous dynamics. In this dynamics we apply a local rule f with a probability Œ± (the synchrony rate) or we keep the same state with a probability 1 ‚àí Œ±, independently for each cell. Note that by taking Œ± = 1, we recover the synchronous case (i.e. parallel updating) and as Œ± is decreased, the update rule becomes more asynchronous.

In the context of ECA, an Œ± ‚àí asynchronous dynamics can be written as a diploid ECA as:

œÜ=Œ±f1 +(1‚àíŒ±)f2 (3) with f2 being the rule 204 (identity rule!).

QUESTION: consider now the thee Œ± ‚àí asynchronous dynamics, when f1 ‚àà {6, 50, 178}. With simulation parameters similar to the Simulation Studies, draw (part of) the space time diagrams with Œ± = 0.25, Œ± = 0.50 and Œ± = 0.75, starting from a random initial configuration. What do you observe? How does qualitatively change the approach to the equilibrium as Œ± increases?

QUESTION: try to estimate the curve of the equilibrium density in function of the parameter Œ±, for f1 ‚àà {6, 50}. Are there any critical value of Œ±? Try to give an heuristic explanation of what you observe, underline the differences between the two ECA.
